### About the repository:
____

This repository will store my pet projects. The idea of each project is that I study some technology, and then do some task that I came up with myself. Iâ€™ll also be writing about my upcoming learning plans.

##### Analytical microservice for apartment analysis in Moscow:
- In this project, I got familiar with parsing, specifically using the library (BeautifulSoup), and also studied Docker â€” huge thanks to my colleague Anton for that, hereâ€™s his excellent [course](https://karpov.courses/docker). Going forward, I want to dive deeper into parsing, namely:
  - selenium (I started, but didnâ€™t finish the basics);
  - parsing Telegram;
  - asynchronous parsing.

I also started to realize that I enjoy cleaning data and working with data delivery in one way or another, so maybe Iâ€™ll take a course in [DE](https://karpov.courses/dataengineer). Anyway, doing and learning something new is fun :)

And the project itself can be seen [here](https://github.com/0n1xx/Pet_projects/blob/main/parcing_flats/parcing_flats_avito.ipynb).


##### ðŸŽµ Spotify Statistics
In this project, I got familiar with working with external APIs, specifically using the Spotify API through the Spotipy library. I also continued studying Airflow for orchestrating ETL processes and ClickHouse for storing analytical data. Docker and Docker Compose helped me keep everything organized across services.

Going forward, I want to dive deeper into data pipelines and visualization:
- enriching Spotify data with external sources (genres, moods, etc.);
- building more advanced Superset dashboards;
- experimenting with real-time streaming pipelines.

I also started to realize that I enjoy orchestrating data flows end-to-end, from ingestion to visualization â€” so maybe Iâ€™ll explore more tools in the Data Engineering stack. Anyway, doing and learning something new is always fun :)
