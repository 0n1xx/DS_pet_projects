### About the repository:
____

This repository will store my pet projects. The idea of each project is that I study some technology, and then do some task that I came up with myself. I’ll also be writing about my upcoming learning plans.

##### Analytical microservice for apartment analysis in Moscow:
- In this project, I got familiar with parsing, specifically using the library (BeautifulSoup), and also studied Docker — huge thanks to my colleague Anton for that, here’s his excellent [course](https://karpov.courses/docker). Going forward, I want to dive deeper into parsing, namely:
  - selenium (I started, but didn’t finish the basics);
  - parsing Telegram;
  - asynchronous parsing.

I also started to realize that I enjoy cleaning data and working with data delivery in one way or another, so maybe I’ll take a course in [DE](https://karpov.courses/dataengineer). Anyway, doing and learning something new is fun :)

And the project itself can be seen [here](https://github.com/0n1xx/Pet_projects/blob/main/parcing_flats/parcing_flats_avito.ipynb).
